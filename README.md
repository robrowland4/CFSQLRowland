SQL-based work from Career Foundry coursework.
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a fictional movie rental company, for the sake of this project, that used to have stores around the world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive. In this project, I've been hired as a data analyst by Rockbuster Stealth’s business intelligence (BI) department to help with the launch strategy for the new online video service. The BI department helps other departments, from inventory to customer insights, with data-related queries. My first task was to load all of Rockbuster’s data into a relational database management system (RDBMS). Then, I used SQL to analyze the data and answer any ad-hoc business questions that other departments may have. I eventually compiled the results of the analysis into an easily digestible format, which will be presented to the Rockbuster Stealth Management Board.
Data set was created for this project and consisted of Rockbuster's film inventory, customers, payment records, etc.
